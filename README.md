Welcome to WATT2BUY.


This product is for residential and commercial property owners considering renewable and sustainable energy technology for their power needs. Watt2Buy is an automated investment advising website that provides its users with renewable and sustainable product recommendations based on a series of factors based on survey inputs.
Unlike other price comparison websites like Google Shopping and NexTag, Watt2Buyâ€™s concentration on sustainability within residential and commercial buildings allows our recommendation algorithm to match each user to a handful of products that are optimal and realistic for their specific investment situations
    Find your customized plans today by taking our survey! We'll ask about your energy consumption, building type, location, budget, and more to figure out a plan that is most suitable for you!
